## Assignment 2 - Checking for Anagrams using Java

### Description
This program checks if two strings are anagrams. It removes whitespaces, handles case insensitivity, and uses a `HashMap` for efficient character counting to compare the two strings.

### Features
- **Whitespace Handling**: The program ignores spaces in both strings for accurate comparison.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Handles uppercase and lowercase letters as equal.
- **HashMap Utilization**: Efficient character counting to ensure accuracy.
- **Validation**: Returns `true` if the strings are anagrams, otherwise `false`.
